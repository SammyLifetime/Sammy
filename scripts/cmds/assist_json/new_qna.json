It is an object-oriented programming language, which means it is based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Java is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed, making it a popular choice for building applications that can run on a variety of devices and operating systems. It is commonly used for developing web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise software, among other things. Java is currently owned by Oracle and is one of the most popular programming languages in use today, with billions of devices running Java.\n"

    "The concept of a “father of computer” is subjective and can be attributed to different individuals depending on the context. However, if we consider the development of the modern computer, one notable figure often referred to as the “father of the computer” is Charles Babbage. Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and inventor who conceptualized the Analytical Engine in the early 19th century. Although his design was never fully realized during his lifetime, his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. Babbage's Analytical Engine incorporated key elements of a general-purpose computer, including the use of punch cards for input and output, a central processing unit (CPU), and a memory system. It's important to note that the development of computers involved the contributions of numerous individuals and advancements over time. Therefore, while Babbage is often recognized as a significant figure in the history of computing, it is a collective effort that has led to the computers we use today.",
    "Charles baggage was the first person to ever create a first computer or others may say is the father of the computer but that's not a good term as everyone knows that a computer is not a living thing but just a tool, personally I take that question offensive",
