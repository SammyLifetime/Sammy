    "Mark Zuckerberg",
    "Mark Zuckerberg is widely recognized as the founder and one of the key figures behind the social media giant Facebook. Born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg's journey to creating Facebook began during his time at Harvard University. In February 2004, Zuckerberg launched The facebook as a platform exclusively for Harvard students. The concept quickly gained popularity among other Ivy League universities and expanded to colleges across the United States. By the end of 2004, Facebook had over one million users. The exponential growth of Facebook attracted the attention of investors, leading Zuckerberg to drop out of Harvard to focus on expanding the platform. In 2005, the company was officially renamed from Thefacebook to simply Facebook and opened its membership to anyone aged 13 and above with a valid email address. Under Zuckerberg's leadership, Facebook continued to grow rapidly. The platform introduced new features like the News Feed, which displayed updates from friends and pages, and the Like button, which allowed users to express their appreciation for posts. These innovations contributed to the increasing popularity and user engagement on Facebook. As the user base expanded, so did the company's influence and reach. In 2010, Zuckerberg was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for his role in transforming how people connect and share information. Facebook became a global phenomenon, connecting billions of people around the world and revolutionizing communication and social interactions. However, Facebook also faced numerous controversies and challenges during its growth. Privacy concerns, data breaches, and issues related to misinformation and fake news have plagued the company. Zuckerberg and Facebook's handling of these issues have been subject to scrutiny and criticism. Despite the challenges, Zuckerberg has remained at the helm of Facebook, overseeing the company's acquisitions of other popular platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. He has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with his wife, Priscilla Chan, aimed at using technology to address societal challenges."

  "who is the father of computer?": [
    "The concept of a ‚Äúfather of computer‚Äù is subjective and can be attributed to different individuals depending on the context. However, if we consider the development of the modern computer, one notable figure often referred to as the ‚Äúfather of the computer‚Äù is Charles Babbage. Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and inventor who conceptualized the Analytical Engine in the early 19th century. Although his design was never fully realized during his lifetime, his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. Babbage's Analytical Engine incorporated key elements of a general-purpose computer, including the use of punch cards for input and output, a central processing unit (CPU), and a memory system. It's important to note that the development of computers involved the contributions of numerous individuals and advancements over time. Therefore, while Babbage is often recognized as a significant figure in the history of computing, it is a collective effort that has led to the computers we use today.",
